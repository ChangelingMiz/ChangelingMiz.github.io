## Mongod and Synced boxes

## Mongod Box

Two machines in one day? Why not, lets try it.

Seems to be about Databases.  Guessing that's what the DB is in MongoDB

OOH MongoD(B) - good one HTB

Doing the standard ping, nmap, checking TCP ports, and getting Version information (though, NMAP took forever for some reason)

Getting Mongodb installed onto my VM, connecting with port 27017, learning Mongo commands allong the way

Got the flag by navigating through the DB and dumping the file into terminal.


## Lets also do Synced, why not

Learning about rsync, more about FTP, and delta

Normal ping, TCP port check, and version check

Connecting to machine with rsync to try to find the flag - learning rsync syntax along the way. 

Noticing a lot of similarities in all the syntax, might have to stop looking up specifics soon

Brought the flag.txt file over to my laptop, read it, submitted the flag. 

Two done, time for dinner.
