## The Preignition Box in HTB

Starting the Preignition Box, which seems to be a brute-force tutorial (Dir busting)

VPN struggles as always with HTB, seems to be a very common issue. Can't Ping a machine for the first while

Realizing it's because I changed my HTB username to match this one, cleared cache, downloaded new VPN, and removed the old ones

*Finally got a ping* 

Struggling a bit with using GoBuster since I don't quite know where the files are yet, but soldiering through it - finally finding the one I need. 

Finding Admin/php, and knowing basic admin creds are admin admin, was able to score the root flag!
