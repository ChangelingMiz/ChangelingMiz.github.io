## Trying my first Non starting point box

Trying the Precious box, haven't ventured out of the Starting Point walkthroughs yet

Ping the machine, NMap it for ports and version.

See that port 80 is running ngnix, try to connect directly to the website - cannot connect to website

Try Gobuster to find pages anyway, throwing back errors. Look up those errors, curl the IP and get code 302 - temp moved

Not sure what that means, but try to display 302 directly 

Hit error again, look up walkthrough to see if people don't get a "page not found"

Others get a PDF converter website, guessing my machine is having issues or my network is blocking something

Going back to starting point to learn more
