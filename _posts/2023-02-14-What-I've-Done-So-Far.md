##What my progress is so far

So far I have:
Setup my Kali Linux VM on my laptop
Setup HTB VPN
Started the Starting point machines

While doing this, downloading tools not pre-loaded into my VM
Reading all the documentation with the Starting Point machines
Not much has really happened, but I am making slow and steady progress through them
