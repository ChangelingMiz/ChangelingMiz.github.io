## What my progress is so far

So far I have:

- Setup my Kali Linux VM on my laptop

* Setup HTB VPN

* Started the Starting point machines


While doing this, I have downloaded tools not pre-loaded into my VM

Read all documentation with the Starting Point machines

Not much has really happened, but I am making slow and steady progress through them
